Once editing finishes press Esc button to enter ex mode.  
- If you save and quit type `:wq`

## > If you see E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)  

## press i button switch insert mode and cary on.


2. nano  
`[train@localhost play]$ nano ~/datasets/simple_text.txt`  
modify your document 
 For save and exit 
 ```
 Ctrl+O 
 Enter
 Ctrl+X
