- The places where images are stored are called Image Registry.
The most popular of these is the Docker Hub.

- The images produced by Docker and companies are stored under the official name. Since tested, they are more reliable.

- Users can also create a repository and store it here.
Unlimited public repository and one private repo is free of charge. User/unofficial images generally located **\<username\>/\<imagename\>** format.

- We can now download everything from Hub. Everything about Docker is in the Hub, excluding documentation.
